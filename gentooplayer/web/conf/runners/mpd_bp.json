  "description": "Mpd parameters ([**INFO**](https://linux.die.net/man/5/mpd.conf) [**INFO2**](https://www.musicpd.org/doc/html/)) \n **Use mmap (ALSA):** Setting this allows you to use memory-mapped I/O. Certain hardware setups may benefit from this, but most do not. Most users do not need to set this. The default is to not use memory-mapped I/O. \n **Buffer Time:** Sets the device’s buffer time in microseconds. Don’t change unless you know what you’re doing.Increasing it may help to reduce or eliminate skipping on certain setups. Most users do not need to change this. The default is 500000 microseconds (0.5 seconds). \n **Period Time:** Sets the device’s period time in microseconds. Don’t change unless you really know what you’re doing.Increasing this can reduce CPU usage while lowering it can reduce underrun errors on bandwidth-limited devices. Some users have reported good results with this set to 50000, but not all devices support values this high. Most users do not need to change this. The default is 256000000 / sample_rate(kHz), or 5804 microseconds for CD-quality audio. \n **Mixer Type:** Specifies which mixer should be used for this audio output: the hardware mixer (available for ALSA, OSS and PulseAudio), the software mixer or no mixer none. By default, the hardware mixer is used for devices which support it, and none for the others. \n **Audio Buffer Size:** Adjust the size of the internal audio buffer. Default is 4 MB.This specifies the size of the audio buffer in kibibytes. The default is 2048, large enough for nearly 12 seconds of CD-quality audio. \n . \n . \n .",
