WARNINGS:

for some options of the "twk" command there is no function to restore the original options.
To do this you must continue to "hand"

Instructions on how to reactivate some functions.

4) Info on deactivation of HDMI, the console and ssh
if you do not use a monitor it is useful to turn off the HDMI and at this point also the linux cosol, so you still have one less service at the start.
It is still possible to access the ARS via ssh.

Once you have reached a certain setup, you might think of also disabling the ssh (option 6 of the "twk" command).
We would have as active task only the chosen player/players and/or LMS.

BUT IT WILL NOT BE MORE POSSIBLE TO ACCESS THE RPI:
to restore everything you need to connect the SD card to another PC with linux.

a) mount the two partitions

mount /dev/sdX2 /mountPoint/
mount /dev/sdX1 /mountPoint/boot

b) edit the config.txt file

nano /mountPoint/boot/config.txt

delete the line --> hdmi_blanking=2

c) give the command

echo "c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty1 linux" >> /mountPoint/etc/inittab

d) remove the SD card
umount /mountPoint/boot
umount /mountPoint

e) reactivating ssh
started the Rpi connected to a monitor, log in and give the command

rc-update add sshd default

at the next restart, ssh will be active

to activate it immediately

rc-service sshd start
or
/etc/init.d/sshd start

5) change network/LAN kernel parameters

This option modifies some kernel parameters on the network.

offers 5 different and interchangeable options including restoring the original settings

################################################## ##########

6) Remain the search for the swap at boot and the related service

If you do not use a swap partition (as it is by default) it might be useful to make this change

to reactivate it, you must give the command

rc-update add swap boot
